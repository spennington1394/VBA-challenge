# VBA-challenge

Created a script that loops through all the stocks for a year and outputs the following:
 
 -The ticker symbol
 -Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year
 -The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
 -The total stock volume of the stock 
 
 There is conditional formatting that will highlight positve change as green and negative change as red
